I'm a Graduate Student  at University of Colorado, Boulder kicked off at Fall 2019. Enrolled in Master of Science in Electrical Engineering Program with specialization in Embedded Systems and IoT Firmware Design. Completed Principle Of Embedded Software Design , IoT Firmware Design courses while currently enrolled in Real Time Embedded Systems Design and Advanced Embedded Software Design during my graduate journey.

Working on  projects such as BLE mesh based Smart Ware House System and developing firmware drivers for I2C, UART , DMA, ADC/DAC ,SPI during my coursework gave me a deep insight into wireless technologies, low power system design and bare metal firmware design. I have also worked on FreeRTOS and implemented task scheduling and message queues along with semaphores and mutexes for mutual exclusion and process signaling purposes.  

<h2>Work Life at Larsen and Toubro Ltd.</h2>

I was posted at Larsen and Tourbo limited which is a large conglomerate company in India as a Graduate Engineering Trainee. I was deputed to Doha, Qatar for testing and commissioning of Building Automation and Control Systems to be installed for Qatar Rail Project. Integrated the system with and designed sequence of operation for critical situations such as fire. The Ladder logic was designed accordingly and the system was tested on SCADA before final handover to client.

Upon promotion to Senior Systems Design Engineer, I was engaged in the Automation Design Team. I worked on designing of smart Electrical Meters (at Madhya Pradesh Paschim Kshetra Vidyut Vitaran Company Ltd.) in collaboration with Cyanconnode which implements Narrow Band RF based mesh technology with a total count of 16444 meters spread across 15 zones. The data from the Electrical Meters was logged into cloud based network hosted on ctrl S data center. I have also worked on control design for PID control of process variables like Pressure, Flow and Temperature across gas pipelines. Working on SCADA and ladder logic for automating process plants and implementing RTU systems to transmit data over GSM network  broadened my scope in automation domain.

<h2>Back to the academics (Undergraduate school)</h2>

I started my undergraduate school (Bachelors in Electronics and Telecommunication) at Vivekanand Education Society's Institute of Technology. Taking courses such as Microcontroller based Systems design and Operating Systems concepts created strong foundations in Embedded Systems world. I have developed AVR based portable oscilloscope and Self Balancing Platform as part of my curriculum. I also got an opportunity to collaborate with Department of Radiation Detection and Instrumentation to  develop low power embedded firmware for gamma radiation detectors implementing MSP430 controller. The radiation levels were logged in the external memory implementing onboard RTC unit. I also interned at Department of Remote Handling and Robotics where I designed servo models and implemented haptic feedback control for telerobotic manipulators. Implemented Interoperable Teleoperation Protocol wrapped in low overhead UDP packet to reduce latency in packet transmission. Taking courses and relevant projects encouraged me to dive into career opportunities in Embedded Systems Domain.   


<h2>O hail Open Source!</h2>

Being a firm believer in open science framework and the principle of reproducible work, I actively publish my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/surajthite). It allows me to be a part of a vibrant and intelligent open source community.
